### Description

Project explores contagion horror themes (i.e. zombies, plagues, infection, etc) and how they have influenced fear during the COVID-19 pandemic by exploring Twitter data as a form of expression of fear, and IMDB data as an indicator of popularity of contagion horror in media before, and after, the pandemic.
